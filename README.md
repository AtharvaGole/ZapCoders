### Description
There are multiple features provided. Newcomers can create there own profile despite having no prior knowledge of how to 
build a profile as dropdown lists are provided for most inputs. Here, We have created an algorithm which works in similar manner to Neural-Networks i.e it has weights, which are  
set dynamically. Thus results are pretty accurate, and no prior training and collection of database, thus time is saved.
Also mailing function is implemented to notify users about the same.
